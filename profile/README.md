We are dedicated to creating innovative technology solutions that drive progress across industries. Our projects span a wide range of applications, from tools and platforms to systems and software that help enhance everyday experiences.

## Code Repositories

All of Valence’s code, including both open-source and private projects, is stored and maintained here. 

- **Public Repositories**: These are available for anyone to explore, contribute to, and collaborate on. We believe in the power of community-driven development, and our open-source projects are designed to foster collaboration and innovation.  
- **Private Repositories**: Some of our projects are private and stored here for internal development, testing, and experimentation. These repositories are critical to our work and are not yet open for public collaboration but will evolve as we continue building.
